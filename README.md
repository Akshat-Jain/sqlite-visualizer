# SQLite Visualizer

This is a learning project to understand how SQLite stores data on a page level.

This project is inspired by [this tweet](https://x.com/invisal89/status/1910490337640145394).

All code of this project is being generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro. The purpose is to learn based on what gets generated, question what gets generated, re-iterate until it's correct.
